                In this <a href="https://t.co/cQxQ2GNe5S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk</a>, I had the privilege of presenting a comprehensive overview of my experience in the field of Learning from Demonstrations. I discussed the evolution of LfD techniques from feature-based methods to modern generative approaches such as GAN-based learning, and highlighted how these methods have shaped current trends in both robotics and character animation.

                While learning from demonstrations has become a widely adopted strategy, many practitioners choose methods based on precedent or anecdotal success rather than a systematic understanding of the algorithmic factors driving performance. Drawing on our extensive experience in the field, we developed <a href="/post/lfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Feature-Based vs. GAN-Based Imitation: When and Why</em></a>, a comprehensive survey designed to provide structured guidance and serve as a practical resource for the community.
